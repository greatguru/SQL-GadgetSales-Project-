Based on the information gotten from the analysis above, the cheapest device, Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen), sold 10 units, while the most expensive device, Canon EOS R6, sold 8 units. Therefore, the cheapest device had a higher quantity sold.

The result is so because customers may find the Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) more affordable and accessible compared to the Canon EOS R6, which is a higher-priced camera. The Echo Dot is a popular and budget-friendly smart speaker, often purchased for its voice-controlled features and compact design. Its lower price point may have made it more appealing to a wider range of customers, resulting in a higher quantity sold.

On the other hand, the Canon EOS R6 is a professional-grade camera that offers advanced features and capabilities, making it a preferred choice for photography enthusiasts and professionals. However, its higher price may have limited its appeal and accessibility to a smaller customer segment, resulting in a lower quantity sold compared to the Echo Dot.

Overall, the quantity sold is influenced by various factors, including price, product features, target market, marketing strategies, and customer preferences.
